## F.A.Q.

### Why are this package not available in package control?

I consider this a very niche package, and I would feel bad, if it were to clutter all the package lists on 
non-gaming programmers.

### It does not work! / Why does it not do this?
If you find any problems or if you have any suggestions, please make an issue here on GitHub. If you do not use
